Type Control
================================
Type Control is an OM on Smogon's forum's Other Meta's section.
Introduction
--------------------------------
Since the inception of Pokemon, many Pokemon have been plagued with abominable types. Have you always wanted to use Articuno effectively in OU, but couldn't due to its horrendous type? Type Control is a metagame that allows you to use any Pokemon with any type. Typings are altered through nicknaming your Pokemon! If you nickname your Celebi Dragon/Fairy, it will become a Dragon/Fairy type! Nicknames also reveal a Pokemon's typing, which makes the metagame more consistent as there's less deception involved. It's also worth noting that Mega Pokemon can be used with any type; if you Mega Evolve your Water/Fire Charizard to Mega Charizard-X, it will keep its Water/Fire typing. *[(directly from original thread)][1]*

This is one of the mods that this repo has to offer.
